# Piece of Cake: Delicious Desserts that are a Piece of Cake to Make

![Image of the project on various devices]()

For my Practical Python and Data-Centric Development Milestone Project I have decided to create an interactive Dessert Recipe website that provides an enjoyable user experience which in turn will encourage repeat use.

Users can browse the attractively displayed range of desserts and then click to view the full recipe, or use the seach functionality to quickly find something already in mind. Users are encouraged to Register/Log In to submit a recipe of their own.

## UX
 
I was inspired to create Piece of Cake from a combination of my love of delicious desserts and my non-existant baking knowledge. My experiance of existing dessert websites is that the recipes are written by proffesional chefs and assume a high level of knowledge and skill. As a layman, I found this intimidaing and off-putting. I want to provide a resource where recipes can be submitted by real people, for real people.  

I took a Mobile-First approach to developing Piece of Cake but the website is equally enjoyable when accessed on all devices and screen sizes. 

### User Stories

- As a user, I want the opening page to look great and inspire me to explore the recipes.
- As a user, I want the range of desserts to be displayed in an attractive fashion and with the key bits of information easily viewable.
- As a user, I want to be able to view full details of a recipe with just one click.
- As a user, I want navigation and use to be simple and intuative.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a recipe that I'm interested.
- As a user, I want to be able to easily submit my own recipes.
- As a user, I want to be able to view the recipes I have submitted and have the option to edit or delete them.
